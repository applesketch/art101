	<h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
	<p> This Lab experiments with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<div>
			<p> We did not encounter any big challenges, but we did discover that calling a function while passing an array through its parameter results in appending to the end of the array rather than applying the math to each number in the array. For clarification, we our function returned an addition of 4 to a parameter. So the result was our [array]4. </p>
		</div>

		<h2> Problems</h2>
		<div>
			<p> We only ran into minor problems - we were double checking if the
        equations we were putting in for the functions were correct. When we
        got errors in the console, we found out quickly that we were missing
        either a semicolon or a parenthesis. They were very quick fixes that took
        less than five minutes to solve. </p>

    <div> <p>Here are the results of our functions and callbacks:</p></div>
