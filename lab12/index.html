	<h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
	<p> This Lab experiments with Javascript elements.</p>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<div>
		<p> We had trouble understanding what input type did. </p>
	</div>

	<h2> Problems</h2>
	<div>
		<p> One of the problems we've encountered was trying to figure out why we weren't seeing the output
    on the website locally, despite not getting any errors in the inspector. We figured it - it was because in one of the
  lines, it was a + instead of a =. </p>
	</div>

	<h2> Results </h2>
	<div>
		<p>Here are the results of our conditionals:</p>
	</div>
	<div class="input-output">
		<p>Sorting sorter that sorts stuff: enter your name for sorting:</p>
		<input type="text" id="input">
		<button id="button">Submit</button>

		<div id="output">
	</div>
