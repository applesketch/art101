	<h1>Challenge</h1>
	<p>For Lab 4, we faced multiple challenges that hindered our ability to complete the tasks. We were not sure exactly what certain instructions were referring to and what was supposed to be included.</p>

	<h2>Problems</h2>
	<p> The problems we encountered include:</p>
	<p> Atom's Teletype: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> We spent a bit of time trying to figure out how to use it. We couldn't figure out how to see the other person's tree and files. </li>
			<li> We had to figure out how Teletype worked through trial and error, and clicking on things until we figured out how it worked. </li>
		</ul>
	<p> Task 3:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>We did not know which pseudocode we were supposed to use (from Task 1 or 2) or if we had to use both.</li>
		<li> The instructions were a bit vague, and we were confused on what Javascript was for when using HTML. What was the point of doing the comments in Javscript if we were gonna put it in HTML? </li>
		<li> We weren't sure if we had to modify the Author Block. (and we didn't understand what 'use period' meant). </li>
		</ul>
	<p> Task 4: </p>
	<ul>
		<li> We didn't know what the "code" tag exactly did (even when looking it up and comparing the changes with and without "code", there seemed to be no difference except the change in font).</li>
		<li>We didn't know what the "pre" tag did either (until looking it up), but we could see the difference in the size of the font. </li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Results</h3>
		<p> This is our results: </p>
		<p>We included both pseudocodes from Task 1 and Task 2 below since we did not know which one to use.</p>

<p>Task 1 pseudocode</p>
	<pre> // How to have a decent sleeping schedule.
	  // Get ready for bed at a certain time.
	    // Recommended: According to https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-time-should-i-go-to-bed/, the optimal sleeping time is 10PM.
	    // Take a shower, brush your teeth, do whatever skincare routine you need before 10PM.
	  // Set an alarm for the next day
	    // Recommended: According to https://www.womanandhome.com/health-wellbeing/best-time-to-sleep-and-wake-up/#:~:text=The%20best%20time%20to%20wake,the%20body's%20processes%20to%20work. the optimal time to wake up is from 7AM to 9AM to get seven to nine hours of sleep.
	  // Get on the bed, lay down and close your eyes.
	    // If you can’t fall to sleep easily, some tips to help your sleep better include:
	      // Find a comfortable position.
				// Turn off all electronics.
	      // Drinking warm milk.
	      // Have a good sleeping environment - setting your thermostat around 68 degrees and having white noise (such a fan, Youtube rain noises video, etc.) in the background may help.
	      // Close all lights and curtains for optimal darkness.
	  // Keep sleep schedules consistent for optimal productivity and energy. </pre>
