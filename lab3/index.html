	<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
	<p>This lab focused on creating a local file structure as well as adding and editing index.html files</p>

	<h2>Process</h2>
	<p>All steps were easy, since all I had to do was edit the existing index.html files within the art101 project folder. What I did struggle on was formating my pages cleanly and neatly in a way that looked visually appealing and organized.</p>

	<h3>Outcome</h3>
	<p>Here are some screenshots of the file structures of the index.html files in my folder directory (left) and in Atom (right).</p>
